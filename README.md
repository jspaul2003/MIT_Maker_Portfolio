Greek Demo: https://jspaul2003.shinyapps.io/greekapp/

Math Demo: https://jspaul2003.shinyapps.io/MathPresentations/

Contains:

- greek_app folder
- math_app folder
- greek_app_schema
- math_app_schema
- MathPresentationsAppTutorial.pdf

The greek_app folder contains the R Shiny app and code for the Greek Presenter I built over Math S-139 ("Reading Euclid's Elements in Greek").

The math_app folder contains the R Shiny app and code for the Math Proofs and Problems Presenter I built for the Harvard College class I TA'd in August (RA-23 "Real Analysis").

(NB: each of these wont work their own as is, because the SQL database name, host, user, and password has not been configured)

The greek_app_schema folder contains the SQL file for the Greek app's database schema.

The math_app_schema folder contains the SQL file for the math app's database schema.

The pdf is a (slightly modified) guide on how to use the math presenter I wrote for the Harvard College students in RA-23.
