Greek Demo: https://jspaul2003.shinyapps.io/greekapp/

Math Demo: https://jspaul2003.shinyapps.io/MathPresentations/

Contains:

- greek_app folder
- math_app folder
- greek_app_schema
- math_app_schema
- MathPresentationsAppTutorial.pdf

The greek_app folder contains the R Shiny app and code for the Greek Presenter I built over Math S-139 ("Reading Euclid's Elements in Greek").

The math_app folder contains the R Shiny app and code for the Math Proofs and Problems Presenter I built for the Harvard College class I TA'd in August (RA-23 "Real Analysis").

NB: Each of these wont work on their own as is because the SQL database name, host, user, and password have not been configured. There are "toolkits" referenced in the apps as these were used in Math S-139 to create new diagrams for Euclid's proofs that also worked in different geometries.

The greek_app_schema folder contains the SQL file for the Greek app's database schema.

The math_app_schema folder contains the SQL file for the math app's database schema.

The pdf is a (slightly modified) guide on how to use the math presenter I wrote for Harvard College students in RA-23.
